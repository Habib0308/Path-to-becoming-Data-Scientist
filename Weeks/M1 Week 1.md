## Practice
I came across a website called [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/) that has a lot of problem questions in which I can practice python.

I practiced some programs from [here](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php)


To practice Python I will highly recommend [hackerrank](hackerrank.com) because hackerrank is a very good platform to work on your coding skills. For me I have worked on the [hackerrank/algorithm](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms) section a lot in the past and enhanced my programming skills in many ways. 

It took me a while to get along with hackerrank.  But Once I Started, now it has become a daily habit. Everyday I will pick up  a problem from hackerrank and I will try to solve it. Sometimes it takes me 30 minutes but sometimes it can take me one to two hours to solve a certain problem.
Everyday I will learn something new.  

I solved the programs from the [python domain](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) on hackerrak from the following filers:
