## Time Spent
* #### Time spent on Video-lectures
2 hours daily watching video lectures
* #### Time Spent on Reading
1 hour daily on reading material
* #### Time Spent on Coding
3 hours daily Coding
* #### Time Spent on Project*
* #### Time spent Daily
Total time daily spend was 6 hours a day. 
#### How i managed my time
Mostly I would program in the mornings because the mind is fresh at that time and during the rest of the day I would watch the video lectures and solve quizzes for the course. I would read the documentation by the end of the day.





### Other Activity:
Each link will take you the the Files in which i have all the work done.
I solved the programs from **[Hackerank/Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)** from the following filers:

## Reading Material
I read the following pages frrom the [python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) siteI read the following pages from the [python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) 





## Practice
I came across a website called [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/) that has a lot of problem questions in which I can practice python.

To practice I chose the following programs from **[w3resource / python-basic-exercises/](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php)**

### Codes:
Each link will take you the the .ipynb file in which i have all the codes.
#### **I/O**
I Didn't solve these but I'm just sharing so you can practice these.
*Question numbers*:

1, 5, 13, 37, 88, 119, 120, 130, 135

#### [**Variables Calculations (Click for Code file)**](https://github.com/habibanalytics/Python_Exercises/blob/master/Variables_and_I_O.ipynb)
*Question numbers*:

*Question numbers*:

28, 29, 58, 68, 81, 82, 83, 84, 110, 149

#### [Hackerank/Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
To practice Python I will highly recommend [hackerrank](hackerrank.com) because hackerrank is a very good platform to work on your coding skills. For me I have worked on the [hackerrank/algorithm](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms) section a lot in the past and enhanced my programming skills in many ways. 

It took me a while to get along with hackerrank.  But Once I Started, now it has become a daily habit. Everyday I will pick up  a problem from hackerrank and I will try to solve it. Sometimes it takes me 30 minutes but sometimes it can take me one to two hours to solve a certain problem.
Everyday I will learn something new.  

I solved the programs from the [python domain](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) on hackerrak from the following filers:
