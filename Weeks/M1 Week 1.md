# **Week 1**
This was my first week. In the first week I completed a python course from coursera.

## Courses In Progress

* [Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python)
* [Using Databases with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python)
* [Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-visualization/home/welcome)
* [Basic Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics?specialization=social-science)
* [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)


## Courses Completed This Week
* [Python for everybody (Getting started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python)

### My Linked-In
Certifications attached on [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/habib-ur-rehman/)

## About Completed course
It's a great course that teaches you the basics of programming, Underlying structure of the computer, how the computer thinks, how the computer works with the programs etc.

This course Talks about:
* variables
* if else statements
* loops
* try except

## Reading Material
I read the following pages frrom the [python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) siteI read the following pages from the [python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) site

* Whetting Your Appetite
* Using the Python Interpreter
..* Invoking the Interpreter
....* Argument Passing
....* Interactive Mode
..* The Interpreter and Its Environment
....* Source Code Encoding
* An Informal Introduction to Python
..* Using Python as a Calculator
....* Numbers
..* First Steps Towards Programming
* More Control Flow Tools
..* if Statements
..* for Statements
..* The range() Function
..* break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops
..* pass Statements

## Time Spent
* #### Time spent on Video-lectures
I spent about 2 hours daily watching video lectures
* #### Time Spent on Reading
I spent about 1 hour daily on reading material
* #### Time Spent on Coding
I spent about 3 hours daily Coding

So a total of 6 hours a day in the first week. Mostly I would program in the mornings because the mind is fresh at that time and during the rest of the day I would watch the video lectures and solve quizzes for the course. I would read the documentation by the end of the day.

## Practice
I came across a website called [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/) that has a lot of problem questions in which I can practice python.

To practice I chose the following programs from **[w3resource / python-basic-exercises/](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php)**

### Codes:
Each link will take you the the .ipynb file in which i have all the codes.
#### **I/O**
I Didn't solve these but I'm just sharing so you can practice these.
*Question numbers*:

1, 5, 13, 37, 88, 119, 120, 130, 135

#### [**Variables Calculations (Click for Code file)**](https://github.com/habibanalytics/Python_Exercises/blob/master/Variables_and_I_O.ipynb)
*Question numbers*:

1, 4, 10, 15, 30, 38, 39, 40, 59, 60, 61, 62, 65, 66, 67, 68, 73, 91

#### [**If else (Click for Code file)**](https://github.com/habibanalytics/Python_Exercises/blob/master/If%20Else.ipynb)
*Question numbers*:

16, 18, 21, 23, 24, 33, 34, 35, 36, 89, 109, 124, 138, 147

#### [**Loops (Click for Code file)**](https://github.com/habibanalytics/Python_Exercises/blob/master/Loops.ipynb)
*Question numbers*:

28, 29, 58, 68, 81, 82, 83, 84, 110, 149

#### [Hackerank/Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
To practice Python I will highly recommend [hackerrank](hackerrank.com) because hackerrank is a very good platform to work on your coding skills. For me I have worked on the [hackerrank/algorithm](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms) section a lot in the past and enhanced my programming skills in many ways. 

It took me a while to get along with hackerrank.  But Once I Started, now it has become a daily habit. Everyday I will pick up  a problem from hackerrank and I will try to solve it. Sometimes it takes me 30 minutes but sometimes it can take me one to two hours to solve a certain problem.
Everyday I will learn something new.  

I solved the programs from the [python domain](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) on hackerrak from the following filers:
