# **Week 1**

## Python Progress
This was my first week. In the first week I completed a python course from coursera.

## My Completed Courses
*[Python for everybody (Getting started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python)*

Certifications attached on [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/habib-ur-rehman/)

## About this course

It's a great course that teaches you the basics of programming, Underlying structure of the computer, how the computer thinks, how the computer works with the programs etc.
The things I learned in  this course were mainly Focusing around variables, if else statements, loops, try except.

## Reading
I read the following pages frrom the [python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) site

1. Whetting Your Appetite
2. Using the Python Interpreter
* 2.1. Invoking the Interpreter
*  2.1.1. Argument Passing
*  2.1.2. Interactive Mode
* 2.2. The Interpreter and Its Environment
2.2.1. Source Code Encoding
3. An Informal Introduction to Python
* 3.1. Using Python as a Calculator
* 3.1.1. Numbers
* 3.2. First Steps Towards Programming
4. More Control Flow Tools
* 4.1. if Statements
* 4.2. for Statements
* 4.3. The range() Function
* 4.4. break and continue Statements, and else Clauses on Loops
* 4.5. pass Statements

## Time Spent

For this past week I spent 3 hours on coding, and 2 hours watching video lectures daily.
So a total of 5 hours a day in the first week. Mostly I would program in the mornings because the mind is fresh at that time and during the rest of the day I would watch the video lectures and solve quizzes for the course. I would read the documentation by the end of the day.

## Practice

I came across a website called [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/) that has a lot of problem questions in which I can practice python.

The problem was that the first page almost has 150 programs to solve which is too much.

So I opened the first [page](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php) and sorted the programs topic wise.

To practice Python I will highly recommend [hackerrank](hackerrank.com) because hackerrank is a very good platform to work on your coding skills. For me I have worked on the [hackerrank/algorithm](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms) section a lot in the past and enhanced my programming skills in many ways. 

It took me a while to get along with hackerrank.  But Once I Started, now it has become a daily habit. Everyday I will pick up  a problem from hackerrank and I will try to solve it. Sometimes it takes me 30 minutes but sometimes it can take me one to two hours to solve a certain problem.
Everyday I will learn something new.  

## Codes
The following are the questions i solved from w3resource and hackerrank

Each link will take you the the .ipynb file in which i have all the codes.

## [Hackerank/Python](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python)
I solved the programs from the [python domain](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python) on hackerrak from the following filers:
