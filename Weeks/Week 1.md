# Week 1
This was my first week. In the first week I started a python course from coursera. 
*[Python for everybody (Getting started with Python)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python)*

About this course I  learnt a lot of basics of programming that I will recommend for a beginner level person who doesn't know anything about programming whatsoever to start with this course. it's a great course that teaches you the basics of programming, Underlying structure of the computer, how the computer thinks, how the computer works with the programs etc.
The things I learned in  this course were mainly Focusing around variables, if else statements, loops, try except.

Now for practice I came across a website called [w3resource](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/) that has a lot of problem questions in which I can practice python.

The problem was that the first page almost has 150 programs to solve so I was like 150 programs to practice! Itâ€™s too much.
So I opened up  the first [page](https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/python-basic-exercises.php) and then I  sorted the programs in such a way that which programs are related to if else,  which programs are related to loops, which are related to variables etc. And so I solved the problems accordingly.

To practice Python I will highly recommend [hackerrank](hackerrank.com) because hackerrank is a very good platform to work on your coding skills. For me I have worked on the [hackerrank/algorithm](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/algorithms) section a lot in the past and enhanced my programming skills in many ways. 

It took me a while to get along with hackerrank.  But Once I Started, now it has become a daily habit. Everyday I will pick up  a problem from hackerrank and I will try to solve it. Sometimes it takes me 30 minutes but sometimes it can take me one to two hours to solve a certain problem.
Everyday I will learn something new.  

For this past week I spent 3 hours on coding, 2 hours watching videos daily.
So a total of 5 hours a day in the first week. Mostly I would program in the mornings because the mind is fresh at that time and during the rest of the day I would watch the video lectures and solve quizzes for the course.


The following are the questions i solved from w3resource and hackerrank
