## About this course

## Practice

## Time Spent
For this past week I spent 3 hours on coding, and 2 hours watching video lectures daily.

So a total of 5 hours a day in the first week. Mostly I would program in the mornings because the mind is fresh at that time and during the rest of the day I would watch the video lectures and solve quizzes for the course. I would read the documentation by the end of the day.
