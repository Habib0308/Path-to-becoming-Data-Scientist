first go for statistics.. I applied for this statistics course on coursera and it also has financial aid available which approves in 10-15 days and you can go for it.

Step 1

Statistics Course 1
If you have issues or you prefer youtube thani'll suggest a statistics course from youtube as well:

Elementary Statistics Youtube 


============================================================================================================================

Step 2
Now python is a must have skill and needs no introduction so For me personally i have three scenarios in mind. 

1) A person who just wants to learn syntax should go for this playlist:

Newboston youtube python playlist 

2) A person who wants to learn python from reading material and in detail from start to finish:

Python official Documentation 

And for people who prefer detailed reading:
GeekForGeek

3) A person who wants details but in video format than go for this playlist:

Corey Schafer's python playlist

Also watch his playlist on Programming Terms if you want to know python in detail
Programming Terms
 
===========================================================================================

Step 3
Learn Pandas and basic data analysis.
First Learn from correy Schafar. Honestly he has the best Python Playlist one can think of.

Pandas Playlist

Once you're done with that. 
Also I'd recommend you to search for Daniel chen on youtube and he has like three or four videos on pandas data analysis.

So now you know python, statistics and pandas. Let's dive into numpy than
===========================================================================================

Step 4

For numpy go for numpy official documentation tutorials.

Go to numpy

If you prefer video lecture than seearch for "Alex Chabot" on youtube and he has three or four videos on numpy.

Step 5

Now everyone says lern linear algebra and calculus. Yeah we have to. Sometimes watching videos about ML I get it why they say so.
So for Linear Algebra this man is good. You can learn a lot about LA from his videos but if you don't want to go for it than don't worry .
Trefar Bazett
And I'll Highly recommend you to watch 3blueonebrown's  videos on linear algebra. Consider these a Must Watch
Essence of linear algebra

And you don't have to go for too much details on how to diffrentiate or anything like that to know calculus just watch this playlist to get the better idea of how calculus works. that's all you have to know.
Essence of Calculus

Step 6

Now Comes the part of Learning ML
This is the best course out their. Full Stop.
Andrew NG's Machine Learning course.
If you want to learn the same on youtube which i recomend. It would be this one:
Andrew NG's Machine Learning Course with Python 

Do both of them. The coursera certification of his course is a must have on CV.

and then after you're done with ML go for Deep Learning 
Deep Learning By Andrew NG

Now combine them all. and work on projects. Do some certifications from datacamp
Data camp has a career track thing in its courses so do a yearly subscription and do this one:

Data Scientist
