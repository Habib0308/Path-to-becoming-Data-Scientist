# 6 Months Towards Data Science

I will introduce myself to get started. Iâ€™m Habib-ur-Rehman from a computer science background.

I worked in Java, C# and C++ In the past. But for the past 6-7 months I have not worked in these programming languages. I tried learning python from different resources and so i figured to do it the right way.
 
The topics such as machine learning, python, data science, big-data These topics are really trending these days and are highly in demand in the market. I searched a lot about data science and so I finally decided to become one because it is a respectable job and it pays well.

I talked to data scientists online and from their suggestions I came across a lot of courses that I want to do In order to learn Data Science the proper way.

The idea of sharing this whole experience is that you guys can share with me your opinion, your ideas to help me improve and you can also follow along.

I will share
* My code
* My notes
* Amount of time spent
* My Mistakes
* Links i am learning from
* How i organize my courses


## My Courses Wishlist
I plan to do most of [these courses](https://github.com/habibanalytics/6-Months-Towards-Data-Science/blob/master/Files/Courses%20List.md) within the time of six months. 

Most of my courses are **from coursera** so feel free to check them out because coursera has **financial aid** available and also we can **audit the course** if we want to learn without certification. 

Some usefull blogs to read if you're interested in coursera:

[How to audit the course?](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818613-Enrollment-options)

I am organising all of my courses in a way that i set a target for every month and week and by the end of each month and week I will set the target for the upcoming month and week.

For each course i can study one week's worth content in one day. So that way i can complete courses in fewer days.

By the end of each week I will share my experience in this GitHub repository.
