# Path-to-becoming-Data-Scientist

I will introduce myself to get started. I’m Habib from a computer science background.

I worked in Java, C# and C++ In the past. But for the past 6-7 months I have not worked in those programming languages. So I am back to the beginning. So I completely understand how people feel when they are new to programming.

The topics such as machine learning, python, data science, big-data These topics are really trending these days and are highly in demand in the market. I searched a lot about data science and so I finally decided to become one because it is a respectable job and it pays well. I am not the kind of person who thinks that ‘Do What You Love And The Money Will Follow’. You can watch this video to know why? [Watch](https://youtu.be/gIyYpHupg5M?t=60)

I am from a computer science background who was good at calculus, linear algebra, programming, not particularly good in statistics though. So I thought of starting from scratch.
I talked to a lot of data scientists online and from their suggestions I came across a lot of courses that I want to do In order to learn Data Science the proper way.

The idea of sharing this whole experience is that you guys can share with me your opinion, your ideas to help me improve and you can also follow along.

I planned to do all [these courses](https://github.com/habibanalytics/6-Months-Towards-Data-Science/blob/master/Files/Courses%20List.md) within the time of six months. 

The way I am organising all of my courses is that I will set a target for every month and week and by the end of each month and week I will set the target for the upcoming month and week.

By the end of each week I will share my experience in this GitHub repository. 
I will share my time and organization of courses and sources and codes for all my stuff that i learn and do. 

So Here is my whole experience. I have linked my months and in each month you'll find my monthly target as well as weeks and in each week you'll Find what I did each week along with the time and details of my work done in that particular week.
