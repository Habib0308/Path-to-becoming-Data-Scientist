# 6 Months Towards Data Science

Iâ€™m Habib-ur-Rehman from a computer science background.

I worked in Java, C# and C++ In the past. But for the past 6-7 months I have not worked in these programming languages. 
I tried learning python from different resources and so i figured to do it the right way.

I will share My code, My notes, Amount of time spent, Links i am learning from etc.


## My Plan
I plan to do most of [these courses]() to learn about data science.

Most of my courses are **from coursera** so feel free to check them out because coursera has **financial aid** available and also we can **audit the course** if we want to learn without certification. 

Some usefull blogs to read if you want financial aid on coursera:

[How to Sign up for Coursera Courses for Free?](https://www.classcentral.com/report/coursera-signup-for-free/)

[How to apply for financial aid?](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209819033-Apply-for-Financial-Aid-or-a-Scholarship)

[How to audit the course?](https://learner.coursera.help/hc/en-us/articles/209818613-Enrollment-options)

For each course i can study one week's worth content in one day. So that way i can complete courses in fewer days.

By the end of each week I will share my experience in this GitHub repository.

## My Work
So Here is my whole experience step by step.
### [Month 1]()
