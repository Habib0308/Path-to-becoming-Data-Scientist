First go for statistics.. 

I applied for this statistics course on coursera and it also has financial aid available which approves in 10-15 days and you can go for it.

# **Step 1**

[Statistics Course 1](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics/)

If you have issues or you prefer youtube than i'll suggest a statistics course from youtube as well:

[Elementary Statistics Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7VvPleM5cgTvwm3RMLz3V2VFXQ3DbE0W)

============================================================================================================================

# **Step 2**

Now python is a must have skill and needs no introduction so For me personally i have three scenarios in mind.

**1).** A person who just wants to learn syntax should go for this playlist:

[Newboston youtube python playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGAcbMi1sH6oAMk4JHw91mC_)

**2).**** **A person who wants to learn python from reading material and in detail from start to finish:

[Python official Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)

For people who prefer detailed reading:

[GeekForGeek](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/)

**3).** A person who wants details but in video lectures form than go for this playlist:

[Corey Schafer's python playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTskrapNbzXhwoFUiLCjGgY7)

Also watch his playlist on Programming Terms if you want to know python in detail

[Programming Terms](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsnP0Nl1UDY8VZAlHu1m_MQ)

===========================================================================================

# **Step 3**

Learn some libraries such as Pandas, numpy, matplotlib.

First let's start with pandas Learn from Correy Schafar. 

Honestly he has the best Python pandas Playlist one can think of.

[Pandas Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-osiE80TeTsWmV9i9c58mdDCSskIFdDS)

Also I'd recommend you to search for Daniel chen on youtube and he has like three or four videos on pandas data analysis.


For numpy go for numpy official documentation tutorials.

Go to [numpy](https://numpy.org/learn/)

If you prefer video lecture than search for Alex Chabot on youtube, he has three or four videos on numpy.

The one i reccomend is this one:

[Introduction to Numerical Computing with NumPy | SciPy 2019 Tutorial | Alex Chabot-Leclerc](https://youtu.be/ZB7BZMhfPgk)

For Matplolib sentdex has done good work on that:

[Matplotlib Tutorial Series - Graphing in Python](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQVvvaa0QuDfefDfXb9Yf0la1fPDKluPF)


Now people say learn linear algebra and calculus. to that i'll say that Yeah we have to. 

Sometimes watching videos about ML I get it why they say so. because in the end our data is converted into matrix form and LA helps you in dealing with matrix operations whereas calculus helps in the phase of optimizating our algorithms.


So for Linear Algebra this man is good. You can learn a lot about LA from his videos but if you don't want to go for it than don't worry you don't have to.

[Trefar Bazett](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxfUl0tcqPNTJsb7R6BqSLo6)

But this is a must watch playlist i recomend if you just want to know how LA works
I Highly recommend you to watch 3blueonebrown's  videos on linear algebra. Consider these a  **Must Watch**

[Essence of linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab)

And also about calculus you don't have to learn calculus like solving a lot of calculations or anything, just watch this playlist to get the better idea of how calculus works. that's all you need to know.

**Now you're done with the libraries and also Maths part**

Now Comes the part of Learning Machine Learning

This is the best course out their.  **Full Stop.**

[Andrew NG's Machine Learning Course on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome).

I know a lot of you must be thinking that the course is in octave but don't worry about that, i got you covered.
If you want to learn Machine Learning exactly the same but in python than on youtube It would be this one:

[Stanford CS229: Machine Learning | Autumn 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU)


The coursera certification of Ansrew Ng's course is regognized on CV.

and then after you're done with ML you can go for Deep Learning.

[Deep Learning By Andrew NG](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)


Now combine them all. and work on projects. Do some certifications from datacamp to attach to your CV.


**For people who want one place to learn all.**

Data camp has a career track thing in its courses so do a yearly subscription and do this one:

[Data Scientist](https://learn.datacamp.com/career-tracks/data-scientist-with-python)



In the end my final thoughts on this matter is that learning is a slow process, I know it's a lot to learn but it's the proper way to learn if you have time, otherwise if you want to go for shortcut i don't have anything to say about that, I don't believe in shortcut for complete beginers. Also i have more courses to mention too but It'll be too much to handle or manage.

I can still mention but the above courses are the proper track, so don't leave them to start doing these.

**These are side courses one can do.**

SQL & databases
[Intro to Relational Databases](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-relational-databases--ud197)

[Introduction to NoSQL Data Solutions](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-nosql-data-solutions)

[Computing for Data Analysis](https://www.edx.org/course/computing-for-data-analysis)

You can do this course on algorithms(It's a bit tough)

[Algorithms](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms)

or Learn from youtube
