# Month 1

## My Goals for this month
I want to learn Python and Statistics.

### Goal 1
One of my goal is to complete all the courses from the specialization of [python for everybody](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/python) from coursera. 

The following are the courses from the specialization:
1. [Programming for Everybody](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python?specialization=python)
2. [Python Data Structures](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data?specialization=python)
3. [Using Python to Access Web Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-network-data?specialization=python)
4. [Using Databases with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-databases?specialization=python)
5. [Capstone: Retrieving, Processing, and Visualizing Data with Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-visualization/home/welcome)

### Goal 2
I want to read 'The Python Tutorial' from the official website [python.org tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) by the end of this month.

### Goal 3
I want to achieve a 5 Star - Gold Badge Level on hackerank's python domain by the end of this month.

### Goal 4
Complete the [Basic Statistics Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics/).

### Goal 5
I also want to try out [codesignal-arcade](https://app.codesignal.com/arcade) by the end of this month idk if i can finish it or not but it has a lot of prgrams so I'll try out for two months.

### My Focus in the first month
The main focus in the first month would be Mostly on **python** and **statistics**. Since I had a lot of time with me so I also enrolled in the Machine Learning course by Andrew NG on Coursera as well. 

Since I am from a programming background so I was familiar with fundamentals of programming and also I did some programming on hackerrank in the past So for me, completing a specialization of programming in a month is not a problem so for those people who don't know programming at all should give it at least 2 months.  The problem for me is that I want to get a good grip on python so i want to solve a lot of programs Instead of learning the concepts.

I cannot complete the machine learning course in the first month so the target is to complete it in two months.
I asked my friends who already completed the machine learning course about the prerequisites of the course. They  suggested to me that I don't have to be very good in statistics in order to start this course so that's why I also enrolled in the Machine Learning course.

Following are the courses of Statistics and Machine Learning:

* [Basic Statistics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/basic-statistics/)
* [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
